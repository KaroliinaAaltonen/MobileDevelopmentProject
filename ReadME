To run the app just start the emulator and from the first view select your University from the dropdown menu.
In the next view scroll up and down to see different song lyrics and use the search bar on top of the page to search for specific words or song titles. Press the white
down-arrow on the right-hand side of the search bar to show the result of the search.
